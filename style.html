    My styleguide is truly a representation of my aesthetic I am wanting to portray. It is a mix of different neutrals with bold
    and softer fonts that compliment each other well. I want my portfolio to represent the type of work my client will get with me. 
    I want my work to show that I know a variety of skills and know how to give them what they want while still staying true to who I am
    as a designer.I want this portfolio to eventually be filled with my best designs. I want the viewer to be able to navigate my site easily
    and wanted my colors to makeway for my designs, not distract from. I want the viewers to be drawn to my typography without being overwhelmed
    , and I think I am off to a pretty good start.
